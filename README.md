## Overview

This repository contains comprehensive documentation about Shield, an innovative onchain dApp designed for secure and private data sharing. Shield leverages blockchain technology while maintaining the highest standards of user privacy and data protection.

## What is Shield?

Shield is a Web3 application that enables users to securely share sensitive content onchain with end-to-end encryption and privacy preservation. Built on blockchain principles, Shield combines the transparency and security of distributed ledgers with advanced cryptographic techniques to protect user data.

### Key Features

- **End-to-End Encryption**: All data is encrypted before being shared
- **Onchain Verification**: Cryptographic proofs verify data integrity
- **Privacy Preservation**: User identities and data are protected
- **Token Economics**: Incentive mechanisms for participation
- **Decentralized Architecture**: No single point of failure
