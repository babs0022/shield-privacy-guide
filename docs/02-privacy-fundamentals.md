# Privacy Fundamentals

## Definition of Privacy

Privacy is the right to control information about oneself. In the digital age, privacy means:

- Control over personal data collection
- Transparency about how data is used  
- Ability to limit access to sensitive information
- Protection from unauthorized monitoring

## Why Privacy Matters

### Personal Freedom
Privacy enables individuals to express themselves without fear of judgment or surveillance, essential for free thought and personal development.

### Security
Privacy protections prevent identity theft, financial fraud, and personal targeting by malicious actors.

### Autonomy
When privacy is protected, individuals retain autonomy over their choices and decisions.

## Privacy Principles

### 1. Data Minimization
Collect only the minimum data necessary for intended purposes. Don't gather excessive personal information "just in case."

### 2. Purpose Limitation
Use data only for the stated purpose. Don't repurpose data collection without explicit consent.

### 3. Transparency
Users should understand what data is collected, how it's used, and who has access.

### 4. Access Control
Users should control who can access their personal information and have the ability to revoke access.

### 5. Encryption
Sensitive data should be encrypted both in transit and at rest to prevent unauthorized access.

## Privacy Threats

### Surveillance
Organizations and governments may monitor user activity without consent.

### Data Breaches  
Breached systems expose personal data to attackers and criminals.

### Profiling
Aggregated data enables detailed profiling and targeting of individuals.

### Tracking
Online tracking through cookies and analytics profiles user behavior across platforms.

## Privacy-Enhancing Technologies

- **End-to-End Encryption**: Ensures only sender and recipient can read messages
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Verify information without revealing underlying data
- **Anonymization**: Remove identifying information from datasets
- **Differential Privacy**: Add noise to data to protect individual privacy
- **VPNs & Proxies**: Hide IP addresses and encrypt internet traffic

## GDPR and Privacy Regulations

Modern privacy regulations like GDPR establish rights:
- Right to access personal data
- Right to correction of inaccurate data
- Right to erasure ("right to be forgotten")
- Right to data portability
- Right to object to processing
